# Real-time-driver-drowsiness-detection-using-OpenCV-python
This is an application of image processing where the driver is monitored constantly for signs of drowsiness/fatigue. If he/she is detected with closed eyes for more than a few seconds an alarm is sounded to alert him/her.
This works when a lot of blinks are registered in a short duration of time too.
